But before we could marry, he became a lion –
Thick pelted, and rich with the musk of beast. 
The switch to all fours was not easy – all his weight
slung from the blades of his shoulders.
His deltoids knotted like teak burls,
and I burnished them as he slept.
Burrs matted his mane, and for days
He wouldn’t let me groom him –
slapped me away with a suede paw,
snarled against my throat.
He would not eat fruit, or drink milk,
but tore meat from the bones I provided.
His claws caught in the carpet,
so I stripped the rugs from the floor
and polished the boards until they gleamed
and rang with the chime of his nails.
I stroke his saffron hide
and tangle my fingers deep in his ruff,
draw him up around me, ardent
as the gleam of his topaz eyes
- the hypnotic lash of his tail,
the rasp of his tongue on my thighs.
