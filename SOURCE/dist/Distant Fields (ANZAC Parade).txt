Medalled, ribboned chests, an effort 
carried through them, the war 
still going on inside their heads, 
gathered up for roll call. 
Where all the flowers had gone
came a quiet of ash, 
line after line after line. 
As if the grainy footage played above the leafy street 
my father lifted me on to his shoulders to see. 
My uncles looked to the back of the one in front, 
marching to the heart-beat drum. 
At end of Mass the bugle rose,
life unto life, a single breath
took flight into the bird-light zone.
