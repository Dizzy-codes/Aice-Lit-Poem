I expected a quiet wedding
high above a lost city
a marriage to balance on my head
like a forest of sticks, a pot of water.
The ceremony tasted of nothing
had little colour – guests arrived
stealthy as sandalwood smugglers.
When they opened their suitcases
England spilled out.
They scratched at my veil
like beggars on a car window.
I insisted my dowry was simple –
a smile, a shadow, a whisper,
my house an incredible structure
of stiffened rags and bamboo.
We traveled around roads with English
names, my bridegroom and I.
Our eyes changed color
like traffic-lights, so they said.
The time was not ripe
for us to view each other.
We stared straight ahead as if
we could see through mountains
breathe life into new cities.
I wanted to marry a country
take up a river for a veil
sing in the Jinnah Gardens
hold up my dream, tricky
as a snake-chamber’s snake.
Our thoughts half-submerged
like buffaloes under dark water
we turned and faced each other
with turbulence
and imprints like maps on our hands.
